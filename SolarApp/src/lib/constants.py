PHOTOELECTRIC = """
The photoelectric effect is a phenomenon in physics. The effect is based on the idea that electromagnetic radiation is made of a series of particles called photons. When a photon hits an electron on a metal surface, the electron can be emitted. The emitted electrons are called photoelectrons. The effect is also called the Hertz Effect, because it was discovered by Heinrich Rudolf Hertz, but this name is not used often.
The photoelectric effect has helped physicists understand the quantum nature of light and electrons. The concept of wave–particle duality was developed because of the photoelectric effect.

HARD_SHADE = """“Hard” shade sources stop light from reaching solar cells, such as debri or bird dropping sitting on top of the panel. If even one full cell is hard shaded, the voltage of a solar panel drops to half in order to protect itself. If enough cells are hard shaded, the module will not convert any energy and will, in fact, become a significant drain of energy on the entire system over time.

SOFT_SHADE = """Diffuse shade from a “soft” source, like a distant tree branch or cloud can significantly reduce the amount of light reaching a solar panel’s cells.

FLUX = """Flux is the amount of “something” (electric field, bananas, whatever you want) passing through a surface. Think of flux as the amount of something crossing a surface. This “something” can be water, wind, electric field, bananas, pretty much anything you can imagine. Math books will use abstract concepts like electric fields, which is pretty hard to visualize. I find bananas more memorable, so we’ll be using those.

To measure the flux (i.e. bananas) passing through a surface, we need to know:

*The surface you are considering (shape, size and orientation)
*The source of the flux (strength of the field, and which way it is spitting out bananas flux)
*The strength of the field is important – would you rather have a handful of $5 or $20 bills “flux” into your bank account? - betterExplained.com
